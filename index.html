            <h2>Who are Vicious Cycles?</h2>
            <p> Vicious Cycles is a local store for bikers. These can be casual bikes, mountain bikes, high-performance 
                tricked-out BMX bikes, etc. Alternately, these can be Harley Davidson, an American Eagle, mopeds, scooters, 
                Kawasaki’s, or even concept vehicles. The choice of item is up to you. What brands do you want to sell? 
                Or be a dealer for? Vicious also sells accessories.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p style="clear: left"> Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should 
                    choose it based on the folks who will not only build your bicycle, but also those who 
                    will help you get comfortable on the bike, as well as provide service down the road as you need it.
                    The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding bikes with friends, discovering new places and finding
                     new trails are definitely included. Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic and noisy world 
                     and connect with friends, nature and ourselves. It might just be the best thing ever.
                    Technological advancement, digital exploration and the growing globalization defines the world we live in
                     and will bring more change in the years to come than ever before. It’s a world full of uncertainties where 
                     it’s easy to get lost. But bikes are a very rare breed of products that are completely mechanical and analogue. 
                     There aren’t many products that are so simple yet so sophisticated in their designs. Maybe that is what started 
                     my excitement for bikes as products. The process of observing, designing, improving, engineering and producing bikes 
                     surely is the second-best thing ever.</p>
                     <h2>Owner Bio</h2>
                <p>After spending my whole life on pedals, finishing my degree in mechanical engineering and working 
                    for two large companies making bikes I decided to change my priorities in life. I’ve never been 
                    good at sitting in an office waiting for Friday to come so, decided to start being self-employed.
                     While I started off with engineering projects for companies in the bike industry, I also began to
                      make notes and write down ideas for the bike I would make myself. I soon felt that my excitement
                    wasn’t going to get any less and decided to explore the road of what has now 
                    become Vicious!</p></p>

            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Vicious Cycles Inc is a (your town)-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals 
                in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends 
                to the day-to-day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking 
                scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
                We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance 
                of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. 
                No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
                You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you 
                ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. 
                Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.</p>
